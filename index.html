Operators:- 
    it is used to perform some operation on operands.
todo: Types of Operator
    1. Arithmetic Operator(+,-,*,/,%)
    2. Relational Operator(<,>,<=,>=,==,!=,===,!==)
    3. Logical operator(&&, ||)
    4. Bitwise Operator($, |)
    5. Assignment Operator (=)
    6. Unary Operator(++, --)
    7. Turnary Operator( code ? true : false)
    8. Typeof Operator

! 1. Arithmetic Operator(+,-,*,/,%)
    todo: '+' operator
    Ex: ------





    -> these are used to perform the arithmetic operations
    -> In expression evaluation (+,-) has to be given least priority compare to (*,/,%)
    -> if same priority operators are present in an expression than we should follow left 
        to right associativity.
    Ex:-....


2. Relational Operator(<,>,<=,>=,==,!=,===,!==)
    -> this operators are used to compare any 2 operators
    -> Relational Operator always results in Boolean output(true/false)
    -> Equality Operator(==) : It will check only the data if it is equal or not
        Ex: 10==10  true
            10=="10" true
    -> Strictly Equality Operator(===): it will check both data and data type if it is equal or not.
        Ex: 10===10    true
            10==="10"   false
